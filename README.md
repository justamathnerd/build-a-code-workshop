# Build-A-Code Workshop

This short talk presents an unintuitive probability problem to a middle school or high school audience, and investigates the use of simulation to come up with an answer.

## Presenter Information

The presenter should have a basic understanding of python and computer simulation in general. Basic probability properties should be well-understood.

The presentation works through a student-led comparison of probabilities of two specific events using coin flips. The handout file can be used for students to keep track of their coin flips for each "trial." Use as many trials as you have time for.

## Simulation
